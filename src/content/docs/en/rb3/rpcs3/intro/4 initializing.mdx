Now, **go to the folder where you extracted RPCS3.** Keep this folder open in the background. **Open up RPCS3**.  
**Tick**:
* `Create desktop shortcut`
* `Create Start Menu shortcut`
* `I have read the Quickstart guide`
* `Do not show again`  

**Disable**:
* `Show at startup`  

After that, **click `Continue`.**

## Firmware

**Drag** the **PS3UPDAT.PUP** file you just downloaded from Sony's website **into RPCS3**.  
> <Image src={rpcs3fwdnd} alt="PS3UPDAT.PUP being dragged into RPCS3." />

**Click `Yes`** when the firmware installer prompts you.  
> <Image src={fwinstall} alt="RPCS3's Firmware Installer asking the user if they want to install the firmware named 'PS3UPDAT.PUP'." />

**Let it install.**  
> <Image src={rpcs3fw} alt="RPCS3's Firmware Installer in the middle of installing firmware version 4.90." />

**When it finishes, click `OK`.**  
> <Image src={rpcs3fwdone} alt="RPCS3's Firmware Installer after a successful install of PS3 firmware and LLE modules." />

It will start compiling modules to load the PS3 XMB into the emulator, which may take a few minutes. **You can either let it do its thing or close it.**

## Rock Band 3
Next, **open a new file browser window. Now go to the folder where you have your copy of Rock Band 3 stored and drag the folder into RPCS3's "`games`" folder**.  
Again, you're on your own when it comes to finding a copy. You can use a PS3 with CFW or HEN to create a copy of the game or <a href="https://youtu.be/mRxSKxoYt_g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>["PS3 Disc Dumper"]</b></a> if you don't have a console.  
> <Image src={rpcs3rb3dnd} alt="The dumped folder of Rock Band 3 being dragged into RPCS3's 'games' folder." />

After dragging in Rock Band 3, click `Refresh` in RPCS3. Rock Band 3 should appear in your game library.  
> <Image src={rpcs3refresh} alt="The 'Refresh' button being clicked in RPCS3, which updates it to display Rock Band 3 in the game list." />

## Rock Band 3 Deluxe
Finally, let's install <a href="https://rb3dx.milohax.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>[Rock Band 3 Deluxe]</b></a>.

This is a must-have mod, which also fixes some critical bugs RPCS3 has with Rock Band 3. On top of that, it adds <a href="https://rb3dx.milohax.org/features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>[many great features]</b></a>.

<a href="https://rb3dx.milohax.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>[Click here to download Rock Band 3 Deluxe]</b></a>.

Download the PS3 version.  
> <a href="https://rb3dx.milohax.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><Image src={rb3dxdl} alt="Rock Band 3 Deluxe's .zip archive in Edge's download tray." /></a>

**When it's finished downloading, extract the archive**.  
> <Image src={rb3dxext} alt="Rock Band 3 Deluxe's .zip being extracted with 7-Zip." />

**When it finishes extracting, drag the PKG file into RPCS3 and click `Yes`** on the prompt, just like you did earlier with the PS3UPDAT.PUP file.  
> <Image src={rpcs3rb3dxdnd} alt="Rock Band 3 Deluxe's PKG file being dragged into RPCS3." />

> <Image src={rpcs3pkg} alt="RPCS3's Decrypter/ Installer asking if the user wants to install the Rock Band 3 Deluxe package file." />

The best way to check if Rock Band 3 Deluxe installed correctly is to enable `Prefer Game Data Icons` under `View > Game List Icons`.  
> <Image src={rpcs3gamedataicon} alt="RPCS3, showing a cursor over 'Prefer Game Data Icons'." />

If it installed successfully, you should see that the Rock Band 3 icon has changed.  
> <Image src={rpcs3rb3dxicon} alt="RPCS3's game library, showing an updated icon for Rock Band 3. It's now using the Rock Band 3 Deluxe icon." />

You can also rename the game in the list to "Rock Band 3 Deluxe" if you wish. To do this, right-click on "Rock Band 3" and select `Rename In Game List`.

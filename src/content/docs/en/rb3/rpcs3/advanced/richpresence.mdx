Want to show off to others what song you're in or just want to share the love of Rock Band 3 Deluxe?  
You can do this with the Rich Presence script made for Rock Band 3 Deluxe.  
<Image src={discordrp} alt="A Discord profile showing that they're playing Rock Band 3 Deluxe." />

It is compatible with RPCS3, Xbox 360, and PS3!
## Setup
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="RPCS3">
<Steps>
1. First, we're going to disable RPCS3's presence because it will conflict and look weird.  
Open up RPCS3 then click on the `Config` button at the top.  
	> <Image src={rpcs3config} alt="RPCS3 with the cursor hovering over 'Config'" />

2. Under the `GUI` tab, disable `Use Discord Rich Presence`.  
	> <Image src={rpcs3discord} alt="Disabling 'Use Discord Rich Presence' in RPCS3." />

3. Now, you'll need to download the latest version of <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Python 3]</a>.  
	<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Click here to go to the download page for Python 3]</a>.  
	* It is suggested to install the standalone installer.
	> <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><Image src={webpython} alt="Python's download website. A cursor hovers over 'Download Python 3.12.6.'." /></a>

4. Once it finishes downloading, open the installer.  
In the installer:  
	* Activate `Add python.exe to PATH`
	* Click `Install now`  
	> <Image src={pyinstall} alt="Python's installer with 'Add python.exe to PATH' and 'Install now' are highlighted in tan with a dotted black outline." />

5. After that finishes installing, you'll need to download the `dx_discordrp.py` script.  
<a href="https://raw.github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/develop/scripts/dx_discordrp.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Right click here and then 'Save link as' to download `dx_discordrp.py`]</a>
	> <Image src={pydl} alt="The dx_discordrp.py script in a browser's downloads." />
	Put it in a folder of your preference.  
Since you'll need to launch this every time you want to do this, it should in an easy to reach spot.

6. Go into the folder where you dropped the file.  
In the address bar at the top of your file browser window, type in `cmd` then press the Enter key.  
	> <Image src={cmdopen} alt="A file browser window with 'cmd' typed into the address bar." />

7. Once the command line window opens up, type in:  
`pip install requests pypresence pylast`  
	> <Image src={cmdpip} alt="A Windows command line running the 'pip install requests pypresence pylast' command." />

8. After it has successfully installed the dependencies, type in:  
`py dx_discordrp.py`  
into the command line and press the Enter key.  

9. It will ask you to setup a data path for RPCS3.  
Type in `1` and press Enter.  
	> <Image src={cmdrpcs3} alt="A Windows command line running the 'py dx_discordrp.py' script. It asks the user to select a platform." />

10. After that, you will be asked to enter the path to your RPCS3 installation.  
Drag and drop the folder that contains `dev_hdd0` into the command window then press the Enter key.  
This is usually `C:\Games\RPCS3`.  
**If there are quotes around the path, remove them!**  
	> <Image src={cmdrpcs3dir} alt="Drag and dropping the RPCS3 data path into the 'py dx_discordrp.py' command line." />

11. You will be asked whether you want to set up Xbox 360 or PS3.  
If you want to set those up, please check the other platform tabs.  
	> <Image src={cmdconsoles} alt="'py dx_discordrp.py' asking the user if they want to set up Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3." />

12. During the last step, you will be asked if you want to set up a Last.fm account.  
Type in `1` and expand the section below if you want to set that up.  
Otherwise, type in `2` to set it up later or `3` to never ask again.

## Future Usage
After the initial setup, you won't have to set up anything when you open the file again.

All you have to do is double click the `dx_discordrp.py` file.  
> <Image src={pyopen} alt="A file browser window showing the 'dx_discordrp' python script with a cursor over it." />

If you did everything right, it should show that it has connected to Discord RPC successfully and that it's updating presence.  
> <Image src={cmdrun} alt="A Windows command line running the Discord Rich Presence script." />

That's it! Remember to close it out after you're done and to open it back up when you want to play again.

If it doesn't open correctly, make sure that you've set Python as the default application for `.py` files.  
> <Image src={pydefault} alt="Windows' default application selection. Python is selected and the cursor is over 'Set Default'." />

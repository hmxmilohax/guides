We'll be adding increased memory support to Rock Band 3 on RPCS3. This is strongly suggested and allows for better stability on top of increasing the song limit up to 16000.  
There is no downside to doing this.

## DISCLAIMERS - READ BEFORE CONTINUING
<Aside>If you downloaded and are using a [[Quick Configurations profile]](../../intro/quickconfig/), this is already active and **you don't need to do this.**</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">**If you don't [[enable `Debug Console Mode` in the `Advanced` tab within Rock Band 3's Custom Configuration]](../../customconfig/advanced/), your game to crash immediately after adding this file!!**</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">**This file only works on RPCS3. Using this on a PS3 will cause it to crash!**</Aside>

First, you'll need to [[download the file to enable increased memory support.]](/../../downloads/rb3/rpcs3/customconfigs/memory.zip)  
[[Click here to download it]](/../../downloads/rb3/rpcs3/customconfigs/memory.zip).

**After downloading the .zip file, extract its contents and move them to RPCS3's folder. It should combine folders automatically if you did it right.**

In the GIF example below, the `devhdd_0` folder from the archive (`memory.zip`) was extracted and its contents were moved into RPCS3's folder.

That's it! Enjoy the increased stability and extra song space!

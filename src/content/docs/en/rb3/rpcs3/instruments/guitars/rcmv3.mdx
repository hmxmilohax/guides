Do NOT map this instrument via the `Pads` menu!
</Aside>
<Aside type="caution">RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) **will** cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a <a href="../../main#gamepads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[typing keyboard or a gamepad.]</a></Aside>

* **This is specifically for the <a href="https://shop.retrocultmods.com/products/v3-wii-adapter-for-clone-hero-and-rb4-rock-band-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[V3 Wii/USB Adapter WITH TILT by RetroCultMods]</a>!** Please consult your sales receipt to confirm that it is indeed a V3 Wii/USB Guitar Adapter WITH TILT by RetroCultMods.
    * You can use this page for reference for V1 and V2 Wii Adapters, but you won't have tilt.

## Setup
<Aside type="caution">Before starting, **make sure you stop Rock Band 3**'s emulation in RPCS3.</Aside>

Before starting, be sure to <a href="https://retrocultmods.com/programming-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[download the latest version of RCM Programming Tool]</a>.

Start up up RCM Programming Tool.

In the start screen, set your device to program to. In this example, it was set to `V3 Adapter - RB Guitar`.  
After that, click on `Configure` and wait for the progress bar to finish.  
<Image src={seldevv3} alt="RCM Programming Tool's first screen with 'Device to program' set to 'V3 Adapter - RB Guitar'." />

In `Controller Settings`, change the following:
* Enable `Use USB Passthrough with RPCS3`
<Image src={conset} alt="RCM Programming Tool's Controller Settings. The settings reflect exactly what is above." />

It's also suggested you calibrate your Whammy to have the best experience. Scroll down to the Whammy section and calibrate it.

**MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON `Save Settings` before closing the program or you will lose progress!**

When you're done, close RCM Programming Tool.

You can now launch Rock Band 3!

<Aside type="caution">**Make sure RCM Programming Tool is closed before starting Rock Band 3**!!! Having RCM Programming Tool open while launching Rock Band 3 will cause passthrough to fail, which means your drums will not connect!!!</Aside>

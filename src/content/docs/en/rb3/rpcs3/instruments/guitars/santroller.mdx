<Aside type="caution"><Image src={rpcs3nomap} alt="A warning that says not to map this controller!" />  
Do NOT map this instrument via the `Pads` menu!
</Aside>
<Aside type="caution">RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) **will** cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a <a href="../../main#gamepads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[typing keyboard or a gamepad.]</a></Aside>

* **Please note that your Santroller Configurator may have different settings, depending on how your guitar was modded.** If you purchased your guitar pre-modded, contact the seller for more information.

## Setup
<Aside type="caution">Before starting, **make sure you stop Rock Band 3**'s emulation in RPCS3.</Aside>

If you haven't initialized your controller yet, start up Santroller.

Be sure to <a href="https://github.com/santroller/santroller/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[download the latest version of Santroller]</a>.

In the start screen, select your `Device to program`, `Connection Method`, and `Device to Emulate`. This will depend on what device you're using for your guitar. In the tutorial screenshots, it was a `Raspberry Pi Pico`, `USB Adapter`, and `Rock Band Guitar`  respectively.  
After selecting your options, click on `Configure`.

<Image src={initgtr} alt="Santroller's initial screen. 'Device to program' is set to 'Raspberry Pi Pico', 'Connection Method' is set to 'USB Adapter', and 'Device to Emulate' is set to 'Rock Band Guitar'." />

In `Controller Settings`, change the following:
* Set `Device to Emulate` to `Rock Band Guitar`
* Enable `Use USB Passthrough with RPCS3`

<Image src={consetgtr} alt="Santroller's Controller Settings. The settings reflect exactly what is above." />

It's also suggested you calibrate your Whammy to have the best experience. Scroll down to the Whammy section and calibrate it.

**MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON `Save Settings` before closing the program or you will lose progress!**

When you're done, close Santroller.

You can now launch Rock Band 3!

<Aside type="caution">**Make sure Santroller is closed before starting Rock Band 3**!!! Having Santroller open while launching Rock Band 3 will cause passthrough to fail, which means your guitar will not connect!!!</Aside>

Do NOT map this instrument via the `Pads` menu!
</Aside>
<Aside type="caution">RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) **will** cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a <a href="../../main#gamepads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[typing keyboard or a gamepad.]</a></Aside>

* **This page is specifically for guitars using modded kits made by <a href="https://shop.retrocultmods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[RetroCultMods]</a>!** Check your receipt from either the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/RetroCultMods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[RetroCultMods' own website]</a> or <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/RetroCultMods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Etsy shop]</a> to verify that you indeed have a guitar using a mod kit from RetroCultMods.

## Setup
<Aside type="caution">Before starting, **make sure you stop Rock Band 3**'s emulation in RPCS3.</Aside>

Before starting, be sure to <a href="https://retrocultmods.com/programming-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[download the latest version of RCM Programming Tool]</a>.

Start up up RCM Programming Tool.

In the start screen, set your device to program to. In this example, it was set to `Solderless Kit - PS2/Emulator`.  
After that, click on `Configure` and wait for the progress bar to finish.  
<Image src={seldevsl} alt="RCM Programming Tool's first screen with 'Device to program' set to 'Solderless Kit - PS2/Emulator'." />

In `Controller Settings`, change the following:
* Enable `Use USB Passthrough with RPCS3`
<Image src={conset} alt="RCM Programming Tool's Controller Settings. The settings reflect exactly what is above." />

It's also suggested you calibrate your Whammy to have the best experience. Scroll down to the Whammy section and calibrate it.

**MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON `Save Settings` before closing the program or you will lose progress!**

When you're done, close RCM Programming Tool.

You can now launch Rock Band 3!

<Aside type="caution">**Make sure RCM Programming Tool is closed before starting Rock Band 3**!!! Having RCM Programming Tool open while launching Rock Band 3 will cause passthrough to fail, which means your drums will not connect!!!</Aside>

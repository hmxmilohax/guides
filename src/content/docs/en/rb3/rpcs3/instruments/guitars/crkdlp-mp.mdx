<Aside>**Make sure your guitar and receiver are on <a href="https://crkd.gg/pages/firmware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[the latest firmware]</a>!**</Aside>
* CRKD Les Paul guitars can be connected wirelessly via its respective dongle, Bluetooth, and wired via USB. For Bluetooth, you need a Bluetooth receiver to connect to your computer.
	* Dongle or wired USB are the recommended methods.
* The guitar subtype is set to Rock Band which means tilt will work but flanger FX WILL BE FORCED!
There are two ways to configure this guitar. Pick depending on whichever neck you have.

* This is the recommended configuration for users with the stock "OG" neck.

**Click on the Pads icon at the top of RPCS3**.
<Image src={rpcs3pad} alt="The Pads menu in RPCS3." />
It’s suggested to create a new configuration by clicking `Add Configuration` at the top right of the `Pads` window. 
This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play other games.
<Image src={rpcs3padprofadd} alt="The top right of RPCS3's Pads window. 'Add Configuration' is being clicked on by the mouse cursor" />Follow the instructions and/or match the assignments below.

#### Pad Information

| Handlers | Devices |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| XInput | XInput Pad |

| Device Class | Device Subtype |
|:------------:|:--------------:|
| Guitar | Rock Band |

<Steps>
1. After connecting your guitar, switch the "Platform" selector to the "PC" mode.

#### Mapping

By default, XInput has most things bound correctly. You only need to remap the following:

* **Map** the following:

| **RPCS3** | **XInput** | **Guitar** |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| R1 | ![Right Stick](/assets/instruments/buttons/360/rs.png "Right Stick") | ![Tilt](/assets/instruments/buttons/guitars/ts.gif "Tilt") |

## Profile
[[Download Profile]](/../downloads/rb3/rpcs3//instrument-repo/CRKD%20Les%20Paul%20Guitar.7z)

<details>
<summary>How do I use profiles?</summary>

<Aside type="caution">This is not recommended if you're using multiple controllers at once.</Aside>

After downloading the profile,

1. Extract the .7z file.
2. Drag the `input_configs` folder into the `configs` folder where you have RPCS3 in.  
> <Image src={instrepoinstall} alt="Installing a configuration profile from the Instrument Repo" />

3. After that, you can select the profile in the **“Pads”** menu.  
> <Image src={rpcs3padprofile} alt="RPCS3's Gamepad Settings, showing the cursor over a profile." />

Most of the time, these controller profiles should work out of the box. If they don’t, try changing the controller listed in `Devices`, next to the `Refresh` button until it receives an input. You can edit this while the game is running.

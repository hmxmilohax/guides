Do NOT map this instrument via the `Pads` menu!
</Aside>
<Aside type="caution">RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) **will** cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a <a href="../../main#gamepads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[typing keyboard or a gamepad.]</a></Aside>
* **Please note that your Santroller Configurator may have different settings, depending on how your drums were connected/modded.**  
If you purchased your drums pre-modded or adapter pre-made, contact the seller for more information.

## Setup
<Aside>Before starting, **make sure you stop Rock Band 3**'s emulation in RPCS3.</Aside>

Be sure to <a href="https://github.com/santroller/santroller/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[download the latest version of Santroller]</a>.  
After that, start up Santroller.

In the start screen, select your `Device to program`, `Connection Method`, and `Device to Emulate`.  
In the tutorial screenshots, it was a `Raspberry Pi Pico`, `USB Adapter`, and `Rock Band Drums` respectively **but it may be different depending on your setup!**  
After selecting your options, click on `Configure`.

<Image src={initdrms} alt="Santroller's initial screen. 'Device to program' is set to 'Raspberry Pi Pico', 'Connection Method' is set to 'USB Adapter', and 'Device to Emulate' is set to 'Rock Band Drums'." />

In `Controller Settings`, change the following:
* Set `Device to Emulate` to `Rock Band Drums`
* Enable `Use USB Passthrough with RPCS3`

<Image src={consetdrums} alt="Santroller's Controller Settings. The settings reflect exactly what is above." />

**MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON `Save Settings` before closing the program or you will lose progress!**

<Image src={savesan} alt="Santroller with a cursor is hovering over 'Save Settings'." />

When you're done, close Santroller.

You can now launch Rock Band 3!

<Aside type="caution">**Make sure Santroller is closed before starting Rock Band 3**!!! Having Santroller open while launching Rock Band 3 will cause passthrough to fail, which means your drums will not connect!!!</Aside>

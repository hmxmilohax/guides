## Setup
<Steps>
1. Put the Roll Limitless Adapter in firmware updating mode. To do this, press and hold the rectangular button on the top of the adapter, near the micro USB port.  
    <Image src={fwbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the firmware button circled in red." />

2. While still holding the button, plug it into your computer. If done successfully, the Roll Limitless will show up as a removable drive.

3. <a href="https://https://rolllimitless.com/september-15th-2024-firmwares/#PS3::~:text=PS3%3A,work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Download the latest "PS3" firmware for the drums from the official website]</a>.

4. Place the firmware file on the Roll Limitless device while it's in firmware updating mode (showing up as a removable drive). When it completes, safely remove the device.

5. Plug the Roll Limitless adapter back into your computer while holding down the round Start button.  
    <Image src={startbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the start button circled in red." />

6. Now, **<a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[go to Zadig's website]</a>** and **download the latest version, then open it** up.

7. Click on `Options` then `List All Devices`.  
    <Image src={zadiglistall} alt="Zadig showing 'List All Devices' under 'Options' highlighted." />

8. You should now see devices listed. **Switch it to your Roll Limitless**.  
In this example, it's the Pro Guitar (`Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3`).  
    <Image src={zadigsel} alt="Zadig showing 'Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3' highlighted in the devices listed." />

9. **After selecting the right device, you should see the option to replace the driver.  
_MAKE SURE YOU ARE REPLACING THE DRIVER ONLY FOR THE ROLL LIMITLESS!!_**  
Click `Replace Driver`.  
    <Image src={zadigreplace} alt="Zadig with 'Replace Driver' highlighted." />

10. A warning will appear. **Again, make sure you have selected your Roll Limitless.** After you have made sure, **click** **`Yes`**.  
    <Image src={zadigwarning} alt="Zadig warning the user that they're about to modify a system driver, with 'Yes' highlighted" />

11. It will then install the driver. As the program says, it may take a few minutes.  
    <Image src={zadigprogress} alt="Zadig in the middle of a driver install." />

12. If everything goes well, you will get this message:  
    <Image src={zadigdone} alt="Zadig telling the user that the driver was installed successfully with 'Close' highlighted." />

13. **Close Zadig** and, **with the Roll Limitless** still **connected**, **open up RPCS3** and **open Rock Band 3**.
Turn your controller on and you should see it automatically assign a player number.  
    <Image src={protaron} alt="A Mustang Pro Guitar with the second player LED lit up." />
</Steps>

You will see the instrument ready to join in Rock Band 3, .  
<Image src={rb3player} alt="Rock Band 3 with a Pro Guitar ready to join." />


From this point, you can just connect your Roll Limitless whenever you want without having to repeat this setup process!

<summary>Uninstalling</summary>
Applying a Zadig driver on a device will make it only work on applications with passthrough. Thankfully, reverting this is very easy.  
<Steps>
1. Open the Start menu and search for `Device Manager`. Open it.  
    <Image src={startdevman} alt="Windows' Start menu, with a result of 'Device Manager'." />

2. Scroll down until you find the `Universal Serial Bus devices` category.  
Expand it and right click the instrument you applied the Zadig driver on and then select `Uninstall device`.  
In this example, it's the Pro Guitar (`Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3`).  
    <Image src={devman} alt="Device Manager, with a right click menu that popped up. The cursor is over 'Uninstall Device.'" />

3. In the next window that pops up, make sure to tick `Attempt to remove the driver for this device.`  
4. After that, click `Uninstall` and that's it!  
    <Image src={devmanun} alt="The device uninstall prompt. 'Attempt to remove the driver for this device' is ticked and the cursor is over 'Uninstall.'" />
</Steps>
When you disconnect then reconnect the device, it will revert back to the original driver.

**Click on the `Pads` icon at the top of RPCS3**.

It’s suggested to create a new configuration by clicking `Add Configuration` at the top right of the `Pads` window.  
This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play other games.

Follow the instructions and/or match the assignments below.

3. <a href="https://rolllimitless.com/firmwares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Download the latest "Universal" firmware for the Roll Limitless from the official website]</a>.

4. Place the firmware file on the Roll Limitless device while it's in firmware updating mode (showing up as a removable drive). When it completes, safely remove the device.

5. Plug the Roll Limitless adapter back into your computer while holding down the round Start button.  
    <Image src={startbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the start button circled in red." />

6. Verify that Windows has detected the Roll Limitless adapter by searching for `joy.cpl` in the Start menu.  
    <Image src={joycpl} alt="Windows showing the search results of joy.cpl." />

7. If it shows up, it's ready to go. If not, make sure you're plugging it in while holding down the round Start button.
</Steps>
## Mapping
Rock Band Drums send multiple button presses out at once. For example, a Red pad will send both `Circle` and `L3`. Keep in mind these are needed to the emulator to tell your cymbals apart.

## Profile
[[Download Profile]](/../downloads/rb3/rpcs3//instrument-repo/Roll%20Limitless%20Drums.7z)

<details>
<summary>How do I use profiles?</summary>

<Aside type="caution">This is not recommended if you're using multiple controllers at once.</Aside>

After downloading the profile,

1. Extract the .7z file.
2. Drag the `input_configs` folder into the `configs` folder where you have RPCS3 in.  
><Image src={instrepoinstall} alt="Installing a configuration profile from the Instrument Repo" />

3. After that, you can select the profile in the `Pads` menu.  
><Image src={rpcs3padprofile} alt="RPCS3's Gamepad Settings, showing the cursor over a profile." />

Most of the time, these controller profiles should work out of the box. If they don’t, try changing the controller listed in `Devices`, next to the `Refresh` button until it receives an input. You can edit this while the game is running.

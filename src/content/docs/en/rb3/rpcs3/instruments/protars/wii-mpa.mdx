<Aside type="caution"><Image src={rpcs3nomap} alt="A warning that says not to map this controller!" />  
Do NOT map this instrument via the `Pads` menu!
</Aside>
<Aside type="caution">RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) **will** cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a <a href="../../main#gamepads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[typing keyboard or a gamepad.]</a></Aside>

**You will need:**
* a Santroller based adapter to connect to your computer.

## Setup
<Aside type="caution">Before starting, **make sure you stop Rock Band 3**'s emulation in RPCS3.</Aside>

Switch your RB3 MIDI PRO Adapter and switch it to Guitar mode. Simply set the middle switch to rightmost `G` position.  
> <Image src={mpagtr} alt="A MIDI PRO Adapter with the middle switch set to 'G'." />

Connect the Nintendo Wii MIDI Pro Adapter to your Santroller based adapter, then connect the Santroller based adapter to your computer.

Be sure to <a href="https://github.com/santroller/santroller/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[download the latest version of Santroller]</a>.  
After that, start up Santroller.

If you're using a premade adapter (like the RetroCultMods MiniHost), you may receive a warning from Santroller in the start screen.   
All this means is that you can't ask for support on the official Santroller Discord.  
You can tick the checkbox and focus on the rest of the configuration.  
> <Image src={sanwarn} alt="Santroller warning the user that their device is not designed to be programmed with it." />

Select your `Device to program`, `Connection Method`, and `Device to Emulate`.  
This will usually be `Raspberry Pi Pico`, `USB Adapter`, and `Pro Guitar (Mustang)` or `Pro Guitar (Squier)` respectively.  
After selecting your options, click on `Configure`.  
> <Image src={initmust} alt="Santroller's initial screen. 'Device to program' is set to 'Raspberry Pi Pico', 'Connection Method' is set to 'USB Adapter', and 'Device to Emulate' is set to 'Pro Keys'" />

In `Controller Settings`, change the following:
* Set `Device to Emulate` to `Pro Guitar (Mustang)` or `Pro Guitar (Squier)`
* Enable `Use USB Passthrough with RPCS3`
> <Image src={consetmust} alt="Santroller's Controller Settings. The settings reflect exactly what is above." />

**MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON `Save Settings` before closing the program or you will lose progress!**  
> <Image src={savesan} alt="Santroller with a cursor is hovering over 'Save Settings'." />

When you're done, close Santroller.

You can now launch Rock Band 3 and don't need to touch this anymore!

<Aside type="caution">**Make sure Santroller is closed before starting Rock Band 3**!!! Having Santroller open while launching Rock Band 3 will cause passthrough to fail, which means your Pro Guitar will not connect!!!</Aside>

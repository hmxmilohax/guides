* Nintendo Wii MIDI Pro Adapters can be converted to PlayStation 3. This requires hardware modification and will not be covered here.

### Setup
<Steps>
1. Connect your RB3 MIDI PRO Adapter and switch it to Guitar mode. Simply set the middle switch to rightmost `G` position.  
Please note that you need to do this even if you already did it for the other two modes.  
    > <Image src={mpagtr} alt="A MIDI PRO Adapter with the middle switch set to 'G'." />

2. Now, **<a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[go to Zadig's website]</a>** and **download the latest version, then open it** up.

3. Click on `Options` then `List All Devices`.  
    > <Image src={zadiglistall} alt="Zadig showing 'List All Devices' under 'Options' highlighted." />

4. You should now see devices listed. **Switch it to your RB3 MIDI Pro Adapter**.  
In this example, it's the Pro Guitar (`Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3`).  
    > <Image src={zadigsel} alt="Zadig showing 'Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3' highlighted in the devices listed." />

5. **After selecting the right device, you should see the option to replace the driver.  
_MAKE SURE YOU ARE REPLACING THE DRIVER ONLY FOR THE RB3 MIDI PRO ADAPTER!!_**  
Click `Replace Driver`.  
    > <Image src={zadigreplace} alt="Zadig with 'Replace Driver' highlighted." />

6. A warning will appear. **Again, make sure you have selected your RB3 MIDI PRO Adapter.** After you have made sure, **click** **`Yes`**.  
    > <Image src={zadigwarning} alt="Zadig warning the user that they're about to modify a system driver, with 'Yes' highlighted" />

7. It will then install the driver. As the program says, it may take a few minutes.  
    > <Image src={zadigprogress} alt="Zadig in the middle of a driver install." />

8. If everything goes well, you will get this message:  
    > <Image src={zadigdone} alt="Zadig telling the user that the driver was installed successfully with 'Close' highlighted." />

9. **Close Zadig** and, **with the dongle** still **connected**, **open up RPCS3** and **open Rock Band 3**.
Turn your controller on and you should see it automatically assign a player number.  
    > <Image src={protaron} alt="A Mustang Pro Guitar with the second player LED lit up." />
</Steps>

You will see the instrument ready to join in Rock Band 3, .

From this point, you can just connect your RB3 MIDI Pro Adapter whenever you want without having to repeat this setup process!

<summary>Uninstalling</summary>
Applying a Zadig driver on a device will make it only work on applications with passthrough. Thankfully, reverting this is very easy.  
<Steps>
1. Open the Start menu and search for `Device Manager`. Open it.  
    > <Image src={startdevman} alt="Windows' Start menu, with a result of 'Device Manager'." />

2. Scroll down until you find the `Universal Serial Bus devices` category.  
Expand it and right click the instrument you applied the Zadig driver on and then select `Uninstall device`.  
In this example, it's the Pro Guitar (`Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3`).  
    > <Image src={devman} alt="Device Manager, with a right click menu that popped up. The cursor is over 'Uninstall Device.'" />

3. In the next window that pops up, make sure to tick `Attempt to remove the driver for this device.`  
4. After that, click `Uninstall` and that's it!  
    > <Image src={devmanun} alt="The device uninstall prompt. 'Attempt to remove the driver for this device' is ticked and the cursor is over 'Uninstall.'" />
</Steps>
When you disconnect then reconnect the device, it will revert back to the original driver.

Do NOT map this instrument via the `Pads` menu!

There's two ways to connect this guitar. Pick whichever is the most convenient for you:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Santroller Adapter + Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver (Recommended)">
This is the recommended method because the guitar will work as expected and will be wireless.

**You will need:**
* a Santroller based adapter to connect to your computer.

    Need one?

* an Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows to connect to the Santroller based adapter.

        * Please note that any generic Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver should work fine!

## Setup
<Aside type="caution">Before starting, **make sure you stop Rock Band 3**'s emulation in RPCS3.</Aside>

Connect the Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver to your Santroller based adapter, then connect the Santroller based adapter to your computer.

Be sure to <a href="https://github.com/santroller/santroller/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[download the latest version of Santroller]</a>.  
After that, start up Santroller.

If you're using a premade adapter (like the RetroCultMods MiniHost), you may receive a warning from Santroller in the start screen.   
All this means is that you can't ask for support on the official Santroller Discord.  
You can tick the checkbox and focus on the rest of the configuration.  
> <Image src={sanwarn} alt="Santroller warning the user that their device is not designed to be programmed with it." />

Select your `Device to program`, `Connection Method`, and `Device to Emulate`.  
This will usually be `Raspberry Pi Pico`, `USB Adapter`, and `Pro Keys` respectively.  
After selecting your options, click on `Configure`.  
> <Image src={initmust} alt="Santroller's initial screen. 'Device to program' is set to 'Raspberry Pi Pico', 'Connection Method' is set to 'USB Adapter', and 'Device to Emulate' is set to 'Pro Keys'" />

In `Controller Settings`, change the following:
* Set `Device to Emulate` to `Pro Keys`
* Enable `Use USB Passthrough with RPCS3`
> <Image src={consetmust} alt="Santroller's Controller Settings. The settings reflect exactly what is above." />

**MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON `Save Settings` before closing the program or you will lose progress!**  
> <Image src={savesan} alt="Santroller with a cursor is hovering over 'Save Settings'." />

When you're done, close Santroller.

You can now launch Rock Band 3 and don't need to touch this anymore!

<Aside type="caution">**Make sure Santroller is closed before starting Rock Band 3**!!! Having Santroller open while launching Rock Band 3 will cause passthrough to fail, which means your Pro Guitar will not connect!!!</Aside>

  <TabItem label="MIDI to USB interface">
## SYSEX Notice

<Aside type="caution">**You need a MIDI to USB Interface that has SYSEX support!  
Consult your MIDI to USB interface's manual or manufacturer for more details.**</Aside>

| Verified<br>MIDI to USB interfaces</br> |
|:------------------:|
| **CME**<br>C2MIDI Pro</br> |
| **CME**<br>U2MIDI Pro</br> |
| **Focusrite**<br>Scarlett (4i4 and higher) [3rd Gen]</br> |
| **M-Audio**<br>Midisport Uno</br> |
| **MOTU**<br>M2/M4</br> |
| **Roland**<br>UM-ONE mk2</br> |
| **SSL**<br>+2 MKII</br> |

## Instructions
Since you can't use the dongle, you will need to connect Rock Band 3 Pro Guitar via the MIDI port on the bottom.  
> <Image src={midimustang} alt="A Rock Band 3 Mustang Pro Guitar showing a 5-DIN MIDI output highlighted in blue with a dotted white outline." />

**For this, you will need a MIDI to USB interface**.  
Here’s an example of a MIDI to USB interface. Most will come with an LED indicator to show activity. **To check that you’ve plugged it in correctly, you should see “MIDI In” blinking when you press a key**.  
> <Image src={miditousb} alt="A MIDI to USB interface." />

**If you have an audio interface, you may already have a way to plug in MIDI** to your computer, as some audio interfaces come with MIDI inputs. For example, this Scarlett has MIDI connections in the back.  
> <Image src={midifs} alt="The back of a Focusrite Scarlett showing a USB port, and 5-DIN MIDI input and output." />

After that, **right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, **then click on `Change Custom Configuration`**.  
> <Image src={iog} alt="Rock Band 3's I/O custom settings showing Emulated MIDI Devices, device type, and device selection highlighted in tan with a solid outline." />

* ![A tan square with a solid outline](/assets/rb3pc/config/smalltan.png "Tan Square"):  
    * 🎸 **Change your `Emulated MIDI type` from `Keyboard` to `Guitar (17 Frets)` if you have a Mustang Pro Guitar, or `Guitar (22 Frets)` if you have a Squier Pro Guitar, then select your MIDI to USB interface in the drop-down menu next to it.**

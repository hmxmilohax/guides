Before hopping online, you need to create an RPCN account. RPCN is RPCS3's equivalent of PSN (PlayStation Network.)  
We'll be going over how to create an RPCN account and manage friends on it.

<Steps>
1. **Click on the `RPCN` button**:  
    > <Image src={rpcn} alt="RPCS3's main screen with 'RPCN' highlighted." />

2. Click on **`Account`**:  
    > <Image src={rpcnpopup} alt="RPCS3's RPCN menu with 'Account' highlighted." />

3. Click **`Create Account`**:  
    > <Image src={rpcnaccount} alt="RPCS3's RPCN: Account menu with 'Create Account' highlighted." />

4. Enter a **username** and **password**:  
    > <Image src={rpcnuser} alt="RPCS3's RPCN: Username menu with a username set and 'OK' highlighted" />  
    > <Image src={rpcnpassword} alt="RPCS3's RPCN: Password menu with an obscured password set (twice for verification) and 'OK' highlighted." />

5. You will be prompted for an **email address** so you can receive a **verification token**:  
    > <Image src={rpcnemail} alt="RPCS3's RPCN: Email menu with an email (twice for verification) set and 'OK' highlighted." />

6. Next, you will be asked to confirm your account's creation. **Click `Yes`**.  
    > <Image src={rpcnconfirm} alt="RPCS3's RPCN: Account Creation popup, asking the user if they're ready to create their account, with 'Yes' highlighted." />

7. Now **go to your email inbox to check for your verification token. The email will be called "Your token for RPCN"**.  
You may have to wait a few minutes to get it. If you're still waiting, check your spam inbox.  
**Copy the token**:  
    > <Image src={rpcnemailtoken} alt="An email labeled 'Your Token for RPCN' with a token below what username it's for." />

8. **Paste the token** into RPCS3 and click `OK`.  
    > <Image src={rpcncreated} alt="RPCS3 telling the user an account was successfully created. They are also prompted for the verification token to reset their password in the future." />

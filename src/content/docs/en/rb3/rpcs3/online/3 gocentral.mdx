Thanks to the talented crew at RBEnhanced, the GoCentral project has revived Rock Band 3's online mode.  
This part will be going over how to get join a session.

Before sending or receiving invites, make sure you're online.
For that, open the Start menu and press on `Play on GoCentral` to go online.

2. **Press `Invite Friends`**  
    > <Image src={rb3invite} alt="Rock Band 3 with 'Invite Friends' selected." />

5. You will be asked to confirm if you want to send the message. **Press `Yes` to send it.**

When your friend accepts the invite, they'll be in your session.

## Searching for random people
Searching for random players works just like it did originally.  
**Go to Play Now > Quick Play > Find GoCentral Players**  
> <Image src={rb3findgocentralplayers} alt="Rock Band 3 with 'Find GoCentral Players' selected." />

That's it! You should soon find other players!

Let's go over how to add friends in RPCN.

**Click on the `RPCN` button**:  
> <Image src={rpcn} alt="RPCS3's main screen with 'RPCN' highlighted." />

Click on **`Friends`**.  
> <Image src={rpcnfriendsmenu} alt="RPCS3's 'RPCN' menu, with 'Friends' highlighted." />

This will open the 'Friends' window.

Once here, you can add friends in different ways including:

## Adding by Search
**To add a friend by their username, click on `Add Friend`**, at the bottom side of the RPCN: Friends window.  
> <Image src={rpcnfriendadd} alt="RPCN's Friends window with a cursor hovering over 'Add Friend'." />

A popup will appear. **Type in your friend's username then click `OK`.**  
> <Image src={rpcnfriendaddpopup} alt="RPCN's Friends window with someone's name typed up. The cursor is hovering over 'OK'." />

If you typed in their name correctly, you should see a `Friend added!` popup.  
The icon next to their name will be orange until they add you.  
**Once they accept your request, that's it!**  
> <Image src={rpcnfriendadded} alt="RPCN's Friends window, with the user adding someone by searching their username. Their mouse is hovering over 'OK'. The friend icon is orange." />

## Accepting Friend Requests
Any friend requests will be below `Friend Requests` in the RPCN:Friends window, with a yellow icon next to their name.  
**To accept any requests,** simply **right click the request and click `Accept Request`.**  
> <Image src={rpcnfriendpending} alt="RPCN's Friends window, with the user about to accept a friend request. The icon next to the friend's name is yellow." />

## Adding Recent Players  
Any person you've played with that isn't already your friend will show up in the right side of the RPCN:Friends window.
To add anyone here, simply **right click the name and** you will be able to **send them a friend request.**

Over time, you may end up with a few songs that don't show. This will mostly occur when installing multiple packs that share the same songs.

You can use Nautilus to help solve this problem.

<Aside>**Please note that this is not the same thing as [[songs not showing up due to ID problems]](../troubleshoot/#customs-not-showing-upworking-online--scores-not-saving).**</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Open Nautilus and select `File Indexer`.
    > <Image src={nautilusfileindex} alt="Nautilus' main screen. A cursor hovers over 'File Indexer'." />

2. Click on `Add New Folder`.
    > <Image src={nautilusfileindexaddfolder} alt="File Indexer with a cursor over 'Add new folder'." />

3. Go to where your Rock Band game data folders are.  
This will be `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\` for Rock Band 3 content and usually `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30050\` for Rock Band 1/2 content.
    > <Image src={addfolder} alt="A Windows Explorer window, with Rock Band 3's folder selected. Its name is 'BLUS30463'." />

4. Enable `PS3 Mode (check for songs.dta files)` in the middle then click on `Build Index`.
    > <Image src={nautilusfileindexbuild} alt="File Indexer with 'PS3 Mode (check for songs.dta files)' enabled and the cursor over 'Build Index'." />

5. Click `Yes` on the warning. As it says, it may take a while to scan.
    > <Image src={nautilusfileindexyes} alt="A warning that tells the user that the process of scan may take a while." />

6. After it finishes scanning, click on `Tools` at the top, then enable `Find songs with ID conflicts`.
    > <Image src={nautilusfileindexselid} alt="File Indexer with a 'Tools' dropdown menu activated. The cursor is hovering over 'Find songs with ID conflicts'." />

7. The list at the bottom will now show you songs that have conflicts, usually caused by installing the same song.
<Aside>You may have to increase the window size to see all of the information.</Aside>
    > <Image src={nautilusfileindexlist} alt="A list of songs in File Indexer. Each song is duplicated twice and since they are included in two packs." />

8. While leaving `File Indexer` open, go back to the start page of Nautilus and select `Quick Pack Editor`.
    > <Image src={nautilushomepack} alt="Nautilus' main screen. A cursor hovers over 'Quick Pack Editor'." />

9. Open a file browser window and navigate to the pack's folder that contains the duplicates you want to remove.  
These are usually located in `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR\`.  
    > <Image src={findpack} alt="A Windows Explorer window. It's showing the USRDIR of Rock Band 3, with various folders that are music packs." />

10. Look for the `songs.dta` file. It will be in the `songs` folder, like `USRDIR\[Pack Name]\songs`.  
    > <Image src={findfolder} alt="A Windows Explorer window. It's showing a 'songs.dta' file within a pack's 'songs' folder." />

11. Drag the `songs.dta` file into the `Quick Pack Editor`.  
    > <Image src={nautiluspackdrag} alt="A `songs.dta` file being dragged into Nautilus' `Quick Pack Editor`." />

12. Change `Quick Pack Editor` to `Edit DTA entries and pack contents`.  
Select the songs you want to remove then click `Remove selected`.  
    > <Image src={nautiluspacksel} alt="'Quick Pack Editor' showing some songs selected. A highlight is over 'Edit DTA entries and pack contents' and the cursor is over 'Remove selected'." />

13. When you're done, click `Save` to apply changes.  
    > <Image src={nautiluspackdone} alt="'Quick Pack Editor' with a log that says that the new `songs.dta` was created. The cursor is over `Save`." />

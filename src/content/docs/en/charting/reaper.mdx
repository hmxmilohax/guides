This is a quick setup guide to get REAPER up and running without having to hunt down lots of files from various places.  
All of the included resources are confirmed working and made for the latest version of REAPER and Python.

<Aside>This will NOT teach you how to chart!</Aside>

Please refer to the old but reliable <a href="http://docs.c3universe.com/rbndocs/index.php?title=Authoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[RBN/C3 Authoring Documentation]</a> as it has stood the test of time.
There is also <a href="https://rhythmgamingworld.com/rock-band-3-customs-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[an amazing book by doa]</a> but keep in mind that certain bits of it suggest installing the outdated version of REAPER. You can and should ignore this.   
Likewise, there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHeGkA4nv4g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[a thorough video by Truce]</a> but once again, you should keep in mind that it may mention that you should install an old version of REAPER. You can and should ignore this.

If you have questions or get stuck, you can ask for help in the <a href="https://discord.gg/milohax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[MiloHax Discord]</a>.

This is AI stem separation software that can greatly help in separating a song into separate elements to help with charting. The version linked is a beta version that includes the ability to import Roformer models. Here are the suggested models:
  * Demucs:
    * htdemucs_ft - Essential. Separates into four instruments.
    * htdemucs_6s - Essential and gives you six instruments instead of the usual four.
    * hdemucs_mmi
    * htdemucs
  * MDX-NET
    * UVR-MDX-NET INST HQ 3 or 5 - Essential as it usually gives better vocal isolation than Demucs.
    * <a href="https://github.com/jarredou/models/releases/tag/aufr33-jarredou_MDX23C_DrumSep_model_v0.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Drumsep]</a> - Essential as it separates a stereo drum track into various elements. Helps a ton with drum charting.
* <a href="https://therogerland.tumblr.com/proguide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Pro Guitar Guide]</a> - You're probably never gonna touch Pro Guitar/Bass, but for the masochists, this is the only good guide out there.

## Troubleshooting
* RBN Preview doesn't load!
  * You're missing the appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes. <a href="https://kutt.it/vcpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Click here to download them]</a>.  
  > <Image src={errorplugin} alt="REAPER showing a broken RBN Preview." />
* I get "Error opening devices" when swapping to WASAPI!
  * `Could not find input device`: You probably don't have a microphone connected Change the "Input channels" to `0` in the Device section of Preferences.  
  > <Image src={errordevice} alt="REAPER showing an error that says 'There was an error opening the audio hardware. WASAPI Error: could not find input device'." />
